**Topic:** Movies Analyses Dashboard with DAX  
**Prerequisites:** All data is provided in Movies.xlsx


1. Load Movies.xls into Power BI desktop

2. Remove or impute missing values in Budget and Box Office (e.g., replace with 0 or median) 

3. Ensure all columns are in a appropriate  format.  

4. Create a separate DATE table by using Release Date column, use Addcolumns, Calendarauto, filter functions and make sure a relationship exist in the data model view between two tables.

5. Create the following DAX measures and calculated columns to practice filter contexts, aggregations, and time intelligence. - Create a calculated column called profit by using Budget and Box office column - Create a calculated column to categorize movies by run time for segmentation.   
( - Run Time < 90, Short Run Time > 90 and Run Time < 120, Medium Run Time > 120 , Long ) - Create following measures:
- Total Box Office 
- Average Budget 
- Average Margin 
- Total movies with Oscars 
- Top Genre by Box Office 
- Year-over-Year Box Office Growth 
- Average Nominations per Director
